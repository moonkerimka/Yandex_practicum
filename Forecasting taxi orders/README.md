## Predicting the number of taxi orders at a certain hour

### Tool stack

Time series processing, statsmodels library;
Analysis of the global trend, seasonality, daily and hourly patterns;
feature engineering: splitting the date into components, introducing lags and moving averages;
sklearn and gradient boosting models - CatBoost, LightGBM;
Selection of model hyperparameters using hyperopt.

### Input data

Taxi aggregator analyzes patterns in daily orders to attract more drivers during peak hours.

There is labeled data: the number of orders per hour for several months.

### Target

Build a model to predict the number of orders per hour. The prediction time and RMSE metric should be kept to a minimum.

### Project structure

1. Downloading data and resampling for one hour;
2. Data analysis: trends, seasonality, data type, anomaly search;
3. Training and validation of models;
4. Checking models on a test sample and drawing conclusions.
### Conclusion
ðŸ“‘A study was conducted to predict taxi orders.

Input data - historical data about taxi orders at airports.


ðŸ“Š The time series is stationary. The trend shows a linear increase in the number of orders over time.


ðŸ“Š Linear regression, random forest, decision tree, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, lasso regression and ridge regression models were trained.


ðŸ“Š Found the best hyperparameters for the respective models using GridSearchCV.


ðŸ“Š A comparison of the quality of the studied models using the RMSE metric on the validation set is shown.


Based on the analysis, the conclusion is made:
- the best model with lower RMSE is lasso regression.
- Gradient boosting and Decision Tree models became the worst model.
