## Industry

### Tool stack

CatBoost, Random Forest, Desicion Tree, Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM.
### Input data

historical data of the metallurgical plant "Tak Temper Steel". An exploratory data analysis was carried out to examine the data. Input data - historical data of the metallurgical plant LLC "So we temper steel". 

### Target
To build a model that predicts the temperature of steel.

### Conclusion  
ðŸ“Š The data was pre-processed as follows: the names of the columns were corrected; empty lines are filled; data in columns changed; some columns are removed because they are not informative; added column with full power.


ðŸ“Š Data standardization has been carried out.


ðŸ“Š Linear regression, random forest, decision tree, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM models were trained.


ðŸ“Š Found the best hyperparameters for the respective models using GridSearchCV.


ðŸ“Š The studied models behave in a similar way and select the same features as the most important, such as "key", "Start_temperature", "Wire_1".


ðŸ“Š Comparison of the quality of the studied models using best_score is shown.


Based on the analysis, the conclusion is made:
- the best CatBoost model, then LightGBM, after XGBoost.
- the worst model of Linear Regresion, Random Forest and Decision Tree, they have the lowest best_score.
